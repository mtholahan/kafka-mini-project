# Kafka Mini Project


## üìñ Abstract
This project implements a real-time fraud detection pipeline using Apache Kafka and Python. The system simulates financial transactions, streams them through Kafka, and applies rule-based filtering to flag suspicious activity. The goal is to gain practical experience with streaming architectures, producers, consumers, and containerized deployments.

The workflow includes:

* Running a local Kafka cluster using Docker Compose with broker and Zookeeper services.

* Building a transaction generator that continuously produces randomized account transfers into a Kafka topic.

* Creating a fraud detector application that consumes transactions, evaluates them against business rules, and branches outputs into "legit" or "fraud" topics.

* Packaging all components with Dockerfiles, requirements.txt, and docker-compose.yml for reproducibility.

* Verifying results by consuming messages from output topics, confirming that transactions over $900 are correctly flagged as fraudulent.

Through this project, I gained hands-on skills in stream processing, Kafka topic design, producer/consumer APIs, and containerized workflow orchestration, while also exploring real-world challenges in fraud detection systems.



## üõ† Requirements
- Docker Engine 20.x or later
- Docker Compose v2
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS environment (tested)
- docker-compose.yml defining all services:
  - zookeeper (Confluent cp-zookeeper)
  - kafka broker (Confluent cp-kafka)
  - generator (Python producer app)
  - detector (Python consumer/producer app)
- Python dependency (inside app containers):
  - kafka-python



## üß∞ Setup
- Clone repository and navigate to kafka-docker/ directory
- Build images: docker-compose build --no-cache
- Start cluster + apps: docker-compose up -d
- Verify broker startup logs (Kafka ready)
- Verify generator and detector services running
- Inspect Kafka topics via kafka-console-consumer from broker container



## üìä Dataset
- Streaming data consists of synthetic transactions generated by the producer app
- Transaction schema includes: transaction_id, account_id, timestamp, amount, merchant, location



## ‚è±Ô∏è Run Steps
- Start services with: docker-compose up -d
- Producer (generator) writes messages into topic: queueing.transactions
- Consumer (detector) reads queueing.transactions, applies fraud detection rules, and branches to:
  - streaming.transactions.legit
  - streaming.transactions.fraud
- Verify output using kafka-console-consumer inside broker container



## üìà Outputs
- Two Kafka topics with processed messages:
  - streaming.transactions.legit (valid transactions)
  - streaming.transactions.fraud (flagged transactions)
- Console logs showing consumed/produced records
- Demonstration of near real-time fraud detection pipeline

## üìé Deliverables

- [`- docker-compose.yml`](./deliverables/- docker-compose.yml)

- [`- requirements.txt per fraud-detection component`](./deliverables/- requirements.txt per fraud-detection component)

- [`- Python producer and consumer scripts`](./deliverables/- Python producer and consumer scripts)

- [`- README with instructions`](./deliverables/- README with instructions)




## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture
- Multi-container Docker environment
- Services:
  - Producer app ‚Üí Kafka broker
  - Detector app (consumer + branching producer)
  - Zookeeper for coordination
- Data flow:
  generator ‚Üí queueing.transactions ‚Üí detector ‚Üí (fraud or legit topics)



## üîç Monitoring
- Kafka CLI tools (kafka-console-consumer) to inspect topics
- Docker logs for generator and detector services
- Broker logs for message flow validation



## ‚ôªÔ∏è Cleanup
- Stop services: docker-compose down
- Remove local Docker volumes for Kafka logs/state if re-running
- Delete external Docker network if created manually
